# WastePPELocation_prototype
WastePPELocation is a mobile application created for the conference: XII International Scientific Conference and IX International Symposium of Young Researchers. I named it as a prototype because not all of its functions have been implemented. 
In principle, the application was to be only a proposal to solve the problem with the appearance of a new type of waste in households.

## Interface
The application interface is divided into two parts, which are visible in the first window after its launch. On the login panel shown in figure, 
a user  can  make a  choice  depending  on  whether request  waste  PPE  collection  (“client”  - klient)  or display ongoing waste collection requests (“admin” - firma).
